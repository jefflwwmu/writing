# readme

This fold is based on the book [case files: anatomy] by LANGE press, creating to review anatomy and to combine them with clinical situations for a better memory.

For more information of how to take part in this project, you can contact me @1132199860(qq), and read the **demo.md** which contains the key point of learning a case together.

Anyone who join it, there will be a new case posted every week, and we post our thought and share together. And at the last day of a week, the answer of the case will be posted.

Wish you will engage in it.
